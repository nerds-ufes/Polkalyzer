1. MAPPING == cityname to nodeid in the paths file

2. MAPPING*ANNOTATED == cityname to population mapping

3. TOPOLOGY/CONVERTED.POP.* == IGP weights from actual internet2/geant stats or from rocketfuel inferred weights


4. paths*.GRAVITY == each entry is a pop-pop flow.  the format is path
;FractionofTotalTrafficContributedByThisPath e.g.,  in abilene "1 4 6 8 7 11 10
;0.000762114062241613" --> source is 1 (Settle) destination is 10 (Wash) and
this traffic contributes 0.00076 of the total network traffic, i.e., if the
total number of distinct flows in Internet2 is 8000000, then this path has 5600
flows
